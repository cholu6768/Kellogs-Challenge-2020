# Kellogs-Challenge-2020
Hola, aqui puedes echar un vistazo de mi presentacion para poder tomar parte de este challenge.

I took part of a Kellogs contest in mexico which goal was to find new customers(Stores) in the surroundings of their current current customers. The analysis was for mexico city.
For this contest I used public datasets from Mexico City and a dataset that Kellogs gives to you. I cleaned the data with excel and visualize it using Tableu. My final hypothesis was on choosing new customers based on the population, economy and safety of the area.
I did not make it to the next round but It was totally fine since it was first time testing my analytical skills and I learned a lot and also improved my Tableu/Excel skills.
