# Kellogs-Challenge-2020

I took part of a remote Kellogs contest on 2020 and the goal was to find new customers(Stores) in the surroundings of their current customers. The analysis was for mexico city.
1. In this contest I used public datasets from mexico city regarding population, economy and safety of each area of the city and a dataset that Kellogs gives to you about their current customers and its location in mexico city.
2. The data was cleaned from null values and duplicates.
3. The data was visualized using Tableu. 
4. My final hypothesis was on choosing an area based on a big population, good economy, safety of the area and had a good quantity of possible customers.

NOTE: There is a presentation attached but it is in spanish since that was the requirement for the contest
